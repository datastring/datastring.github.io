Hi, there. 👋 For your own sake, I hope you are not lost.  
Let me help you figure out if you are... 😅

>TL;DR available at the bottom of the post. ~data

## What are we?
I am [~data](https://data.tilde.team). An online identity that aims to make it easier for others to remember and find the work of the person behind me.

## Where are we?

We are in **my blog,** silly! 🙌 I am starting a blog. *Oh, wait...* kind of already did that. Anyway... this is my blog. If you choose to continue your *journey* with me, I'm sorry in advance. 😔 Hah! 😁

## Why are we here?

Our goals are simple: to learn and to teach. 👩‍🏫 For the most part, we are guided by my own personal pedagogy. We also aim to channel our impulses to teach and spread knowledge *away* from my friends and family. I'm not sure how many more rants about insignificant things they can take. 😅 **I love you guys!** 🤟

## Where are we going?

Listen here: I am the captain of this ship. ⛴ I am *not,* however, in complete control of it. What I'm saying is...

🟪***There is going to be purple ahead!***[^2]🟣

## What are we driving?

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext) are the foundation for my note-taking. After that, we will see where this *journey* takes us.

## Up Next ⏭

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Getting organized. *Workflows* don't grow on trees.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Creating a [/now](https://sive.rs/nowff) page.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Creating a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Creating a Homepage. 🏡

## Are we there yet?

**No,** nor will we ever be. The pursuit of knowledge is ongoing and never ending. But we have indeed arrived at the tl;dr section. 🙌

## TL;DR ⌚
I'm ~data. I aim to learn and to teach. Using Markdown and plain text, I plan to turn my thoughts 💭 into a somewhat digestible string of texts that others can then read and *maybe*, juuuust maybe, get some use out of them. 😝

***I don't have a plan for this blog.*** I will be rolling with the punches 🥊 and adapting as new things populate my mind. 🧠 This is a journey of self discovery, self-indulgence, pedagogy and lots of rambling. Like, a lot of rambling.
>It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. -Carl Friedrich Gauss

Are *you* ready for this journey? 🧳 Will you be my **learning partner**? 😊

Thanks,  
~data
